5. **T**: Establish testing, telemetry, and documentation updates for the lore pipeline. **C**: From Testing Guidelines and Documentation Guidelines, ensure coverage ≥80% and docs stay in sync. **R**: Add unit/integration tests for crawler filters, manifest diffing, worker prompts, cache behavior; document in `/docs/code/` and `/docs/tests/`; ensure console logging suffices for debugging without user fallback. **E**: Test matrix, logging strategy, documentation PR checklist. **I**: Run `/scripts/test-suite.sh` before sprint completion; refine tests for reliability.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 3 (data sync).  
**Testing**: Incremental crawl identifies new pages, manifest diff delivers correct delta, WebLLM worker generates coherent five-panel lore, lore UI renders with history, caching rules respected. Run AI integration tests plus new unit coverage for crawler filters and IndexedDB flows.
