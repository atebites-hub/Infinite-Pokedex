### Sprint 3: Client Data Sync & Offline Support ✅

**Branch**: `feature/client-sync`  
**Status**: Ready for merge

**Key Accomplishments**:
- CDNSync class with chunked downloads and resume capability
- VersionManager with semantic versioning and SHA-256 integrity checks
- Service Worker with cache-first and network-first strategies
- OfflineManager with retry queue and fallback responses
- ErrorHandler for centralized error management
- SyncUI with progress bar and browser notifications
- Offline fallback HTML page with auto-retry
- Comprehensive unit tests (sync, version, offline)
- Complete documentation with Mermaid diagrams

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Technology Choices

1. **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS over frameworks**
   - Rationale: Performance and bundle size optimization for mobile
   - Impact: Faster load times, better PWA performance
   - Trade-off: More manual DOM management

2. **On-device AI generation (WebLLM/WebSD)**
   - Rationale: Privacy, offline capability, reduced server costs
   - Impact: Truly offline experience, user data stays local
   - Trade-off: Device resource requirements, model size

3. **Server-side crawling + client-side generation**
   - Rationale: Separation of concerns, scalability
   - Impact: Clean architecture, easier maintenance
   - Trade-off: More complex deployment

4. **CDN-based data distribution**
   - Rationale: Fast global access, reduced server load
   - Impact: Better performance, lower costs
   - Trade-off: Update propagation delay

### Design Decisions

1. **Gen 9 Pokédex (Rotom Phone) aesthetic**
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - CSS animations for game-like feel
   - Purple-blue gradient color scheme

2. **5-panel "iceberg" lore format**
   - Inspired by @starstatik TikTok account
   - Progressive revelation of deeper lore
   - Image + text for each panel

3. **Offline-first architecture**
   - Service Worker caching strategies
   - IndexedDB for local storage
   - Retry queue for failed requests

## Technical Lessons Learned

### Bug Fixes & Solutions

1. **Rate Limiting**: Fixed burst token logic to prevent permanent zero state
2. **Robots.txt Parsing**: Handle multiple colons and malformed lines
3. **Cache Keys**: Include all relevant data, use full SHA-256 hashes
4. **Unicode Preservation**: Use Unicode property escapes for international characters
5. **LLM Response Validation**: Comprehensive validation before accessing nested properties
6. **Text Cleaning**: Preserve valid punctuation while removing invalid characters

### Best Practices Established

1. **Documentation First**: Comprehensive agent reference documents
2. **TCREI Structure**: Task, Context, Rules, Examples, Iteration
3. **Quality Gates**: 80%+ test coverage, security scanning
4. **Conventional Commits**: Structured commit messages
5. **Feature Branches**: Parallel development without conflicts
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, security, E2E

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Chunked Downloads**: 100 species per chunk for memory efficiency
2. **Resume Capability**: Checkpoint system for interrupted syncs
3. **Cache Strategies**: Separate caches for static, dynamic, CDN, images
4. **Cache Limits**: Automatic cleanup when size limits exceeded
5. **Exponential Backoff**: Retry logic with increasing delays

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- Pull requests for code review before merge

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated linting (ESLint, Prettier)
- Security scanning (eslint-plugin-security, npm audit)
- Unit tests (Jest)
- Integration tests (Playwright)
- Build verification

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage requirement
- **Integration Tests**: E2E flows with Playwright
- **Security Tests**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Manual Testing**: Device testing on iOS/Android

## Coordination Protocol

### Multi-Agent Development
- **Communication**: Primary via scratchpad.md, secondary via GitHub issues
- **Branch Strategy**: Dedicated feature branches per agent/sprint
- **No Cross-Dependencies**: Agents work independently
- **Success Metrics**: All tasks complete, tests pass, docs updated

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Code Documentation**: JSDoc for all functions
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams for complex systems
- **Cross-References**: Link related documentation
- **Living Documentation**: Update docs with code changes
